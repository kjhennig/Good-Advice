Good Advice bits

The first thing I remember about coming to Terrace was the mosquitoes.  You 
couldn't breathe here.  It was like the years on the prairies ..but on the 
prairies you couldn't breathe because of the dust.   Here it was mosquitoes
When we first came over the gravel roads from Rupert - the first time I'd ever 
been out, you know to Terrace and I just never forget those mosquitoes.  Oh, 
they were bad.  Just impossible to believe now that those mosquitoes were so 
bad that ou couldn't breathe.  I remember thinking "when we get a little money, 
enought, what I'm going to do with that money is build a little place outside 
and put up screes.  Where I can sit and do my work in that screen.

The fun thing to do on Sunday was to get on the train and go to Kitimat for the 
day - and you'd come back the same day.  It was just packed, maybe four cars, 
and that's what everybody in Terrace did for fun.  Thre was one little place 
where you could get an ice cream and a cup of ta.  called Lamb's - 

You had to burn coal for all the heat for that ironing.  YOu had to get up at 
four in the morning with that ironing.
